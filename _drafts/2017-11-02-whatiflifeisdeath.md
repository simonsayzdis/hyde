title: What If...life is death
---
What if life and death is the exact opposite of what we know.<br>
Babies are born in this ungodly show.<br>
We learn that black is black and white is white<br>
But who is to say that two wrongs don’t make a right?<br>
What if black is white and white is black?<br>
Killing in this time and dumping bodies in a sack.<br>
There’s no grey and there’s no gray.<br>
You mean to tell me there’s more to say?<br>
You believe in Hell and you believe in Heaven.<br>
Superstitious wishing well and lucky number seven.<br>
You believe in this invisible being, many called God.<br>
Well if you can’t explain life and can’t explain death.<br>
Then we should agree that in this world we know less.<br>
Just take a moment and look up at the ceiling.<br>
When you die, what is your life’s meaning?<br>
