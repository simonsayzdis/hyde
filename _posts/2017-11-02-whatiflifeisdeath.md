title: What If...life is death
---

What if life and death is the exact opposite of what we know.
Babies are born in this ungodly show.
We learn that black is black and white is white
But who is to say that two wrongs don’t make a right?
What if black is white and white is black?
Killing in this time and dumping bodies in a sack.
There’s no grey and there’s no gray.
You mean to tell me there’s more to say?
You believe in Hell and you believe in Heaven.
Superstitious wishing well and lucky number seven.
You believe in this invisible being, many called God.
Well if you can’t explain life and can’t explain death.
Then we should agree that in this world we know less.
Just take a moment and look up at the ceiling.
When you die, what is your life’s meaning?
