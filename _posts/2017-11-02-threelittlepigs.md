## Three Little Pigs and Their Tenants

Once upon a time, there was a Suidae, a family of pigs, in a forest. There was mama pig, papa pig, and their three piglets. The oldest one is Bacin, the middle one is Heg, and the youngest one is Gees. They had a good relationship with each other, but they don’t like to pay attention in school.

Years have passed and they moved out of their house. They all decided to become landlords. Bacin was the smartest one and he has a knack for protecting himself. The Heg and Gees didn’t pay much attention in school.

Gees bought a two-family house that was made of straws, but it was very roomy and he gets to live in one of them. He put the house under his own name. Heg bought two houses, one for himself and the other for renting out. Both houses were made of wood. Unlike Gees, he put both properties under an LLC for protection. Bacin bought a triplex home for him to live in and a single-family house to rent out. Unlike both his younger brothers, he put both properties under two separate LLC.

The brothers met at a Pigs n Books Cafe to grab a coffee, read a book “U-14”, and catch up with each other.

“You both are wasting money on this LLC nonsense! Especially you, brother Bacin” Gee said to Heg and Bacin.

“Gees, you aren’t too smart. My LLC protects me and I don’t pay as much as Bacin” said Heg.

Bacin decided to stay quiet and just let them ramble about nonsense.

“I have this tenant, Wolfen, that I rented out a year-long lease for my upstairs unit and now I regret it. He is constantly bringing his lady friends and dancing all night long every Friday and Saturday. I am getting a good amount of income from Wolfen for renting the bigger unit.” said Gees.

“See Gees, that’s why you should buy two properties like me. I live in one of them and not have to worry about the noise from my tenant, Wolfie. He pays me even more for the whole house that I am renting out to him. As long as he doesn’t mess up the house then I am happy.” said Heg.

“Well, I am living in on the top unit of the triplex so no noise can bother me and rented the other two out on a month-to-month lease. I have my other house currently vacant probably because my asking rate is too high,” said Bacin.

They all finished their coffee and bought the U-14 books for themselves to read on their leisure time.
